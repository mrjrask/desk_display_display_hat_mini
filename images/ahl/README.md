# AHL logos

The Wolves scoreboard reuses the Hawks drawing helpers but temporarily points them at this directory.  Every opponent abbreviation that comes back from the HockeyTech feed needs a matching `PNG` here, named exactly after the upper-case code.

At minimum ship:

- `AHL.png` — the fallback crest used when a club-specific file is missing.
- `<WOLVES TRI>.png` — the Wolves logo, where the tri-code is `AHL_TEAM_TRICODE` (defaults to `CHI`).

Add more logo PNGs as the schedule feed reveals new opponent abbreviations.
